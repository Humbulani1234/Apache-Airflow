***DESIGN PATTERN AND PROGRAMMING PARADIGM***

    1. Design Pattern - the Python file have a corresponding Jupyter Notebook file, so an interactive jupyter
                        notebook code layout has been adopted
    
    2. Software Paradigm - a Functional paradigm has been adopted
    
    3. Work in progress - the code has been developed merely to show case coding abilities, nor is it designed
                          according to software beased parctices.

***SECURITIES MASTER DATABASE***
  
       1. We present an Algorithm for the design and implementation of a Securities
          Master Database in SQL through a Python API (ORM).

***SECURITIES MASTERS DATABASE DEVELOPMENT STEPS:***

       1. The following functions are described in the source code file:
  
               1.1  Initializing Inputs

               1.2. Extract table and table header functions

               1.3. Extract data (table rows) functions

               1.4. Create a dictionary/Dataframe functions

               1.5. Create an SQL database function

               1.6. Create an SQL Table function

               1.7. Insert data into and SQL Table function

               1.8. Print and SQL Table in python

               1.9. Run the script
